## Introduction to Github Desktop

Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. This helps a team to collaborate in a multi-developer project without stepping on each other's work.

Github is a distributed system so you can develop your code offline or connected to the internet.  To do this, the code you work on is on a local repo which is separate from the remote repo (in the cloud).  When you edit and commit your code, it is alwasy on your local repo.  The remote repo does not know about your local repo until you sync your local work to the remote repo.  With multiple developers, everyone is getting their code from the remote repo when they want to refresh their code with the latest updates.  It's important to check-in and sync your code when finish to minimize conflicts.

1. Getting Started
https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop

2. Create your own repo, HelloWorld in the Web UI and sync it to your local Github repo.
   Mkae a note where on the file system you have configured Github to save your projects/repos

3. Create a file called README.md and a file called helloworld.py

4. Edit README.md & helloworld.py and save them.  In github, if you save a markdown file with the name README.md, it will display the formatted text on the repo's main page.

5. In Github Desktop, add a comment and hit commit.
   Remember to "Push origin" which sync your local commits to the remote repo

6. Check the github.com for your account and repo to see the changes.
